# lab 3 and 4 report
## Description
In this report, based on the previous model, traffic lights and pedestrian are added to the network in order to improve the throughput.
## Traffic Lights
Bascially, a traffic light has four phases to control the flow in a intersection:

With traffic lights, it is clear to see the whole throughput has been imporved(the variables are same with the previous model):

## Pedestrian
According to the requirement, pedestrian crossing should be added to the road network:

This pedestrain crossing has 2 roads to cross, from `WorkPlace` to `ResidentialArea`.

Variables should be set to control the social distance between pedstrain:

From this graph, the maximum throughput of this area is 10.
## Summary
In this job, I knew how to use traffic ligths to control the cars and add pedestrain crossing.
